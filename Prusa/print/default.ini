notes = Checklist before printing:\n\nExtruder E-steps. [Currently set to 424.9 on printer]\nOn printer > Control > motion > Transmission Ratio > Transmission Ratio E = 424.9 [if defaults to 93.0 change in firmware is possible, contact me or download "pronterface", connect your printer while ON via microusb beside the SD card slot, In the command box, type in "M92 E (desired value, currently at 424.9)", click send, then type out "M500" to store settings.\n\nBed is level.\n\nShould remain level, print a bed level disc set to see if there are any changes. I highly doubt the bed will need leveling anytime soon.\n\nBed adhesion: I discourage the use of glue sticks myself, that said a brim is better in my opinion than a glue stick is. Further down in the warping note youll find what that is refering to and how to use it.\n\n**BRIM SETTINGS: I have enabled and dialed in the brim settings, found under skirt and brim under the Print Settings tab. This will help things stick to the bed and with the seperation gap value come apart pretty easily. It is currently set to a width of 3mm and a seperation gap of 0.1mm. with the bed leveled the way it is currently, this seperation gap value should NOT be less than 0.1mm or over 0.2 mm, values you can try inbetween are as follows: 0.1125, 0.125, 0.1375, 0.1438 and 0.15 of course. My tests showed 0.1 was good. Keep in mind this is if you do not use glue and notice prints arent sticking on the bed. NOTE, I have disabled "skirt loop" when brim is active since the brim acts as the loop itself. ** values to test out if needed: 0.1563, 0.1625, 0.1688\n\nFlow rate: Set to 1, bridge flow rate should be slighly lower but that depends on material and temp too. I have calibrated your Bridge settings as well. bridge flow is now at 1 but speed is at 10mm/s\n\nPrint Layers/Height/advance settings:\n\nlowest to highest, keep in mind the higher the initial height the thicker the first layer, and the better it is for compensating for an irregular bed but also does visibly show up on print. I find 0.3 is my go to but 0.35 at most. 0.3250 is a good middle ground.\n\nPrint Heights:\nleft to right from most detailed/slowest to fastest.\n\n0.08125 - 0.1 - 0.1250 - 0.15 - 0.1750 - 0.2 - 0.2250 - 0.25 - 0.2750  [I recommend you print with a default of either 0.2 or if youre like me, 0.1750 is a good middle ground but for larger less detailed items, for instance the oculus cover, printing at 0.25 is perfectly fine]\n\nInfill: set to gyroid at 20%, this should be a great default but even lower percentages work fine in gyroid\n\nRetraction values: Currently set to 0.8 at 40mm retraction speed. I would try decreasing it to 0.7 or 0.65\n\nKeep in mind no two filament brands or even spools are the same, that said your new extruder is very efficent and dual geared so its very precise. The values you should remain between in my tests is Less than 0.6mm at 25-35mm retraction speed and over or around 0.1mm at 25-35mm retraction speed.\n\nStringing: I have ran tests to reduce this in your prints but it is calibrated to print PLA plus Esun, yellow. If you do notice stringing on a print, keep in mind it could be a few things not working together. I want to highlight these variables so you do not go insane solving these. The first is the cooling fan speed, if molten plastic is cooled too quickly it will solidify and get pulled rather than breaking at hotter temps. non print travel moves, currently set to a default of 130, should not be below 120 or higher than 150, I personally do not push it over 140 myself on most of my printers.\n\nWarping or lifted corners: the solutions is under the Skirt and Brim option, set brim width to 3mm, outter brim only option works fine, and it has an offset value known as brim seperation gap that can be dialed in to make removing brims easier. I have left it at default but you can try these values (I would print a tiny cube to test these) 0.01875, 0.02500, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 [you can now refer to print heights for other values)\n\nWhat causes warped corners? Well I learned the hard way that turning the Bed temp too high can be a bad thing, cause thats how I would fight this, but basicially what is happening is the layer closest to the nozzle is warmest and the first layer or maybe first 5 layers are warm, everything in between is colder, so it shrinks in the middle and wants to warp up from the bed. its why some people use enclosures or heated chambers. PLA and PETG can still work without enclosures because they have a very low shrink factor from cooling,PETG being the better at not shrinking [keep in mind it is like...a stupid small percentage].\n\nElephant foot: This is when the bottom of the object kinda expands wider than the rest, it can be fixed in a few ways, the easiest being turn the bed knobs up one notch and that stops the "squich" but obviously at some point youll find this makes things stick less, so another way is using elephant foot compensation, under the advanced tab of the print settings tab, currently set to 0, could be 0.05, 0.1 etc, go in increments of 0.5 first to see if that helps. Lastly you could always increase initial layer height, so its currently 0.3, going to 0.35 would help. A combination of these can be done, I personally would first do one notch then elephant foot compensation but leave layer height alone, if things dont stick id use brims. At the moment, you do not have an elephant foot issue, if you notice it, it might also be because the first few layers arent cooled, if you notice it only on one side or one corner it isnt the end of the world either, it is very minor or not noticible usually.\n\nCleaning bed surface:\nUse dish soap and a brush of some sort to clean the bed\n\nI discourage the use of CURA to most people because after a decade of printing and various slicers, both paid, free and experimental I have found Cura to be the riddled with variables, it can be tuned but it is an effort in futility.\n
