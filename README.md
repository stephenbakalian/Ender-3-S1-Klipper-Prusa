# Ender-3 S1 Klipper and Prusa


This project is to track my config over time for my Ender S1 with a Sonic Pad.

## Klipper Machine Setting

You can mind the machine settings in the [Klipper Machine Settings](KlipperMachineSettings) folder

## Prusa Settings 

Prusa settigns are in the [Prusa](Prusa/) folder and is broken down into [print](Prusa/print), [filament](Prusa/filament) and [printer](Prusa/printer) settings. Settings that start with a z are provided to me by a friend who helped me with my inital setup.
